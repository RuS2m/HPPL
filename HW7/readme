Take some function R -> R and compute its integral over some segment.

 

CRITERIA:

1. Compute the value analytically (1 point)

2. Compute the integral using trapezoidal rule (1 point)

3. Parallelize using MPI. You should be able to choose any number of MPI processes regardless of the number of discretization points. (2 points)

4. Plot the speedup vs number of processors (1 point)

5. Plot integration error vs the discretization size (1 point)

 

if you have any questions, contact the TAs.
