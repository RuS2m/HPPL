In this assignment, we parallelize home task #4.

You can probably notice that you can perform FFT on different moving windows in parallel. There's even no need to communicate data between processes except at the end when you can make comm.gather/comm.Gather to one process and draw the final picture.

 

CRITERIA:

1. Implement parallel computation of the spectrogram (2 points)
2. Plot speedup vs number of processes (SPEEDUP is not the same a computation time) (2 points)
