A spectrogram is a plot of signal intensity versus time and frequency. It is produced using the windowed Fourier transform. To do the home task use the code provided during the session.

 

CRITERIA:


1. Add 4th wave packet (frequency = 4 and time_shift = 7 cycles). Demonstrate the effect on the plot of the FFT spectrum. (1 point)
2. Implement the spectrogram, show the effect of (1) on the spectrogram. Donâ€™t forget to label the axes (2 points)
3. Change the number of time steps in your signal to the power of 2 (i.e. 2**14) and then slightly change the number of timesteps (i.e 2**14 +- 5). Measure the timing, can you explain the difference? Write something as a possible explanation. (2 points)
