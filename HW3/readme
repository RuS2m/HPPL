1) Suppose there are two types of agents: X and O. Two populations of the two agent types are initially placed into random locations of a neighborhood
represented by a grid. After placing all the agents in the grid, each cell is either occupied by an agent or is empty.
2) Now we must determine if each agent is satisfied with its current location. A satisfied agent is one that is surrounded by at least t percent of agents that are like itself. This threshold t is one that will apply to all agents in the model.
3) When an agent is not satisfied, it can be moved to any vacant location in the grid. Any algorithm can be used to choose this new location. For example, a randomly selected cell may be chosen, or the agent could move to the nearest available location.
4) All dissatisfied agents must be moved in the same round. After the round is complete, a new round begins, and dissatisfied agents are once again moved to new locations in the grid.

 

Steps:
1. Randomize the map with half white/half black
2. define the value of R (0, ⅛, 2/8, ⅜, 4/8, ⅝,6/8,⅞, 1), start the game
3. on each step for each cell find out if the cell wants to move - this
cell is now on the market (considered free for moving in)
4. after you finished with the whole map - cells that want to move
can move into free cells
5. repeat the whole procedure

----------------

CRITERIA:

1. Create 9 gifs of map evolution for 9 values of R (5 points)
2. Plot the number of households that want to move versus time for 9 values of R on one graph, label 9 curves, label the axes and title the graph. (2 points)
