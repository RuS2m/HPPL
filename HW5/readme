In this assignment, we parallelize home task #1.

You can probably notice that you can perform computations on different values of r in parallel. There's even no need to communicate data between processes except at the end when you can make comm.gather/comm.Gather to one process and draw the final picture.

 

CRITERIA:

1. Implement parallel computation of bifurcation map (2 points)
2. Plot speedup vs number of processes (SPEEDUP is not the same a computation time) (2 points)
