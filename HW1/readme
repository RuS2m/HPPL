In this assignment, we study the behavior of the logistic map x |-> r * x * (1 - x).
 

Step-by-step guide:

● implement the map, plot the evolution of x
● play around with values of r, see the change of evolution
● then create a linspace of r’s, for every r save last “m” values of x after first
“n” values (can be m=200, x=200), play around with values
● Get the bifurcation map
● Visualize the evolution (play around)

------------------

CRITERIA:

1. Implement the map, plot the evolution of x (1 point)
2. Create a linspace of r’s, for every r save the last “m” values of x 
after the first “n” values (can be m=200, x=200), play around with
values (1 point)
3. Plot the bifurcation map (1 point)
