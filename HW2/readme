For a fixed complex number c, the Julia set Jc is the set of complex numbers for which the iterative process

z -> z^2 + c

does not diverge to infinity.

 

Step-by-step guide:
● fix a value of C (can be 0)
● implement the map, plot the
evolution of z (Re(z), Im(z))
● play around with values of C, see the change of evolution
● for a given C if the sequence converges use black color, if it diverges use white color, if it starts jumping between “n” values use different colors
● plot the Julia set

CRITERIA:

1. Black and white colors of pixels are correct (1 point)
2. Different colors for bifurcation points (you can also create your own coloring logic or look for proposals on the internet) (1 point)
3. Generate figure of Julia set (c = 1-r) where r is the golden ratio. Label the axes (Re(z0), Im(z0)) (2 points)
4. Plot figures for c=exp(ia), a = range(0,2pi) & write down axes like in subtask 3, create animation of these figures slowly changing the a (3 points)
